Varanasi, a city located in Uttar Pradesh, is more than just the spiritual capital of India. Varanasi is a very popular pilgrimage point for Hindus, and the older part of Varanasi, which has thrived on the banks of the river Ganga, is an integral part of the very infrastructure of the city, with thousands of people flocking there for salvation and purification. All chaos and noise on the ghats of Varanasi take a pause when the Ganga Aarti takes place in the evening, a ceremony of immense grandeur and opulence, with pandits lining up to perform rituals.

The city in and around the ghats has a certain rhythm to it. Narrow maze-like lanes and by-lanes arouse instant intrigue and fascination, while the street art dotting the stretch alongside the ghats makes for a great outpouring of artistic expression. Varanasi also boasts of a marvellous architectural heritage, as can be seen in the scores of temples dotting the city.

One of the oldest cities on the banks of Yamuna, Vrindavan is considered to be one of the most important places of pilgrimage for the devotees of Krishna. It is said that Lord Krishna had spent his childhood in Vrindavan. The name of the city has been derived from Vrinda (meaning basil) and van (meaning grove) which perhaps refer to the two small groves at Nidhivan and Seva Kunj. Since Vrindavan is considered to be a sacred place, a large number of people come here to abandon their worldly life.

The city of Vrindavan hosts hundreds of Lord Krishna and Radha temples scattered throughout, the most famous ones being Banke Bihari temple, ISKCON temple. The vibrant surroundings perfectly depict the playful and benevolent nature of Lord Krishna. Located along the waters of River Yamuna, the numerous temples set amidst the thick woods and lush greenery of Vrindavan are the major attractions here. Also known as Vrindavan, this city derives its name from the groves of Brinda and Vana meaning forest.

A city of kebabs and nawabs, of architecture and history, of literature and culture – that is Lucknow in a nutshell for you. The capital and the largest city of Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow, situated on the banks of river Gomti, welcomes you with a heartwarming note of "Muskuraiyein, kyunki aap Lucknow mein hai". Known as the ‘City of Nawabs’, Lucknow has a charm to it that is hard to resist. While the city itself is rich and opulent, the people of Lucknow also follow an endearing 'pehle aap' (you first) culture, which always leaves behind a smile on the faces of its visitors. From a slice of rich colonial history to modernized museums, the 'City of Nawabs' beautifully brings together the opulence of a glittering past and the simplicity of a modern city.
Rumi Darwaza, the Mughal Gateway built in the centre of the capital divides Lucknow into the 'Old Lucknow' which is ancient, more crowded, and comprises most of the Muslim population, and the 'New Lucknow' which is urban and one of the most planned cities of Asia. Old Lucknow is home to the iconic Mughal monument known as the Bara Imambara, where you will find the Bhool Bhulaiya, which is basically a complex, an intricately designed labyrinth with around 500 almost-identical doors and around a thousand passageways connected by multiple flights of stairs. The Bara Imambara is an architectural marvel in and of itself and is an exemplary embodiment of Awadhi architecture and culture. Close by, Husainabad Clock Tower exhibits traces of Victorian architecture, while Moti Mahal serves as an excellent vantage point for bird watching.

Most of Old Lucknow is well-known for its bustling, vibrant streets, its authentic, mouth-watering kebab and biriyani outlets, its lakhnavi chikan market, and its wholesale jewellery stores.

New Lucknow, on the other hand, hosts people of varied cultures and is structurally planned with wide roads, shopping malls and parks built to serve varied entertainment purposes. The most famous among these parks are the Ambedkar Park and the Gomti Riverfront Park, both ideal places for visiting and strolling around with friends and family in the evening. The Ambedkar Park, in particular, is spread across a staggering 107 acres of land, and is a colossal memorial park built entirely out of red sandstone. Despite being a park, the place doesn’t actually have any trees, and the only nature connect you will find here are the beautiful elephant stone statues, which are eye-catching, nevertheless.

The Marine Drive of Lucknow, situated beside the Ambedkar Park, is a beautiful boulevard devoid of transport, and both locals, as well as tourists, come here during the mornings and the evenings for a casual walk or a jog.

Hazratganj, a major shopping area located in the heart of the city, is famous for its 'chaat' and 'kulfi' eateries, posh Mughlai restaurants, and various shopping complexes.
