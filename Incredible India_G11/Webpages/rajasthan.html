The capital of the erstwhile kingdom of Mewar, Chittorgarh is a land of forts, citadels, ruins, and immortal folklore of sacrifice and heroism. Located in South-Eastern Rajasthan, Chittorgarh is known for Chittorgarh Fort, the largest Fort in India which is a gigantic fort built on a hilltop, spreading over an area of around 700 acres.

Once known for its grandeur and opulence, today, Chittorgarh has left its tales of bravery and betrayal far behind to catch up to commercialization.

Chittorgarh fort will always be remembered for the courageous self-sacrificing Jauhar performed by Rani Padmini to thwart the conquest of the fort by Alauddin Khilji. Rana Kumbha Palace is the largest structure in Chittorgarh fort, and while it is now a mere tumbledown structure of broken walls and piles of stones, it was once a magnificent three-storied palace with gigantic pillars, maze-like underground tunnels and intricately designed architecture. The most famous attraction in Chittorgarh fort is the Rani Padmini Palace, named after Queen Padmini herself. Replete with roof pavilions and water moats, the story of Queen Padmini’s valour rings out loud in every corner of this dilapidated building. Other sights to visit in Chittorgarh include the Meera Temple, the Kali Mata temple, the Gaumukh reservoir, and the Bassi Wildlife Sanctuary.
